# Scripts

Place automation and maintenance scripts here. Examples include:

- Seeders that provision demo domains and hosting spaces.
- Cron jobs to archive stale editor drafts.
- CLIs to trigger site publishing or storage audits.

Document script usage here and reference related modules in [`docs/operational-playbook.md`](../docs/operational-playbook.md).
