# Advanced MFA Module

Policy-driven authentication composer that extends Sentinel Lite with adaptive factors and enrollment tooling.

Planned scope:
- Policy Bus schema for dynamic gate orchestration.
- Enrollment workflows for hardware tokens and biometric rebinds.
- Admin Console hooks for risk-triggered MFA escalation.
- Analytics for gate performance and failure patterns.
