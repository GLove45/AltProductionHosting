ALt Production Hosting want to take the usability of CPanel and easability for unsure userds of WIX or Squarespace and provide a more robust and complete
service without the extra paywalls, each user will sign up for amount of space in GB that they want, from that they have that space and can even ad python, javascript, php, 
the only limit to what they can do is storage.
We want a really user friendly interface with a dev mode option that will just turn off tips and prompts should more basic users need assistance
