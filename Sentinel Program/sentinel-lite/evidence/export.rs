//! Export pipeline for Sentinel Lite evidence bundles.
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//! - Read from the local evidence vault and produce encrypted snapshots.
//! - Upload bundles when connectivity to the operator rack or S3-compatible
//!   storage is available.
//! - Resume interrupted transfers and respect bandwidth policies.
//!
//! ## Workflow Outline
//! 1. Enumerate vault segments that have not yet been exported.
//! 2. Chunk data into resumable pieces, encrypt each chunk, and label with
//!    metadata required for deduplication.
//! 3. Push the bundle to remote storage with exponential backoff on failure.
//! 4. Record success markers so the same evidence is not re-sent.
//!
//! ## Research Topics
//! * Resumable uploads (multipart, RRS, or MinIO client compatibility).
//! * Adaptive backoff tuned for satellite/limited links.
//! * Configurable bandwidth caps to avoid starving production workloads.
//!
//! Like `vault.rs`, this file currently documents design intent until the
//! implementation is prioritized.
