Sentinel Lite collects the minimum telemetry necessary for threat detection:
- Network findings and associated metadata.
- Process integrity alerts derived from `manifest.json`.
- System baselines for file integrity monitoring.

Operators can verify collection scope via `policy.yaml` and the `/policy`
endpoint. Evidence exports are encrypted and access-controlled. Review this
document whenever policy schema or exported fields change to maintain
transparency with device owners.
